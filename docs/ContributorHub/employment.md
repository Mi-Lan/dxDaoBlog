## Employment

### CONTRIBUTOR ONBOARDING / HOW TO ENGAGE

1.  Join Keybase. Go to the [dx_dao](https://keybase.io/team/dx_dao) Keybase. Introduce yourself to the community and express your interests. Then join the #getting-started Keybase channel.
    
2.  Join Daotalk.org. Start reviewing topic discussions and contribute.
    
3.  Attend meetings. Check our weekly [meeting schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=0ptn8lds9nlbj483rpmibnqqfc@group.calendar.google.com) to attend some meetings in the coming week. Make sure to attend meetings that relate to the products and/or areas you would like to work in.
    
4.  Look at [Open Positions and Bounties](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tD4s-IJqZZTG6zbaWlYIdvW65bA9UimdSaiOenBhJ5w/edit). If you see an open opportunity that fits your skillset or a general need that is not being filled, reach out on keybase to get connected with at least one current full-time worker to discuss opportunities. DXdao now has squad leaders that you can also message for more information. See the Squad Leaders section below for a list of current squad leaders.
    
5.  Propose a two-week trial period and scope-of-work at a meeting. The trial period is for two (2) weeks. It can be for part-time (< 40 hrs week), full-time (40 hrs week), or for a specific project. Ask DXdao members to include your worker proposal on the agenda for the meeting that your work would most relate to.
    
6.  Trial Period. If your worker proposal is accepted by the community, then it is time to prove yourself by delivering on the responsibilities you assumed.
    
7.  Draft your first worker proposal. This proposal will encompass a 2.5-month period, including your trial period and the next two (2) months of work. Have your squad leader review your proposal. Note, that your compensation for the first 2.5 months is at a 50% rate of total compensation for the 2-week trial period and at an 80% rate for the following two (2) months. See the Worker Compensation and Worker Proposal Sections (below) for how to draft and submit a worker proposal.
    
8.  Post your worker proposal on Daotalk.org. Allow 5 days for DXdao members to give feedback and a signal on what needs to be changed and whether you should post your proposal on Alchemy.
    
9.  Post your first worker proposal on Alchemy. See the [Worker Proposal Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KnNhG5rOrydifFKQZ9CY7CXCGhN7onEP3UjuFWQb0D8/edit) on how to submit your first proposal on Alchemy.
    

## CONTRIBUTION TYPES & TIME COMMITMENTS

DXdao is a growing community that welcomes contributors in a variety of contexts and for a range of time commitments. This section outlines the various contribution levels with DXdao.

### Contribution Types:

-   Bounties: DXdao posts for tasks that the community needs specialized assistance with. If you complete a task for which a bounty was posted, show your proof of work, and submit a daotalk.org post linking to the bounty. The DXdao community will then signal for you to go ahead with the Alchemy bounty proposal to receive payment.
    
-   Contract Basis: All workers not seeking payment for a claimed bounty are employed through DXdao on a contract basis. That is workers submit a proposal for a scope of work to be completed over a set period of time and are compensated for their contributions. The scope of work stated in the worker proposal creates a contract with DXdao where 50% of compensation is to be paid at the passing of the worker proposal and the remaining 50% of compensation is to be paid at the conclusion of the work period.
   
-   Past Work: It has happened that community members become so involved in DXdao that they almost accidentally end up doing work that the community agrees should be compensated through the DAO. If this is you, please reach out to community members and make a post on Alchemy describing your past work and requested compensation. We appreciate your efforts and believe you should be compensated accordingly.
  
### Time Commitments:
    
-   Full-time: DXdao considers anyone that is working 40 hours per week to be a full-time worker. Any full-time worker will be working on a contract, non-hourly, basis, and so is exempt from claiming overtime hours.

-   Part-time: any worker that works no more than 20 hours per week is a part-time worker. Any part-time worker will be working on a contract, non-hourly, basis, and so is exempt from claiming overtime hours.

-   Percent (%) of Time: Some workers have other commitments and so have opted to commit a percentage of 40 hours per week. A worker’s compensation, based on the Worker Compensation Table, is then calculated on a pro rata basis.

For example, if a worker commits to working 30 hours per week at a level 4 experience level ($7,000 per month in ETH), her salary for the month is adjusted to 75% of $7,000, which would be $5250 in ETH. The same adjustment is also made to the DXD vesting payment.

## TRIAL PERIOD

### 2-Week Trial Period

There is a 2-week trial period at the start of a new worker’s first pay period. The first pay period is 2.5 months. The point of the 2-week trial period is to confirm that the worker is “who they say they are,” meaning she is able and willing to complete the required scope of work. Think of this as an anti-sybil defense.

The trial period is paid at a 50% of salary rate. This also affects REP distribution, meaning REP will be distributed at a 50% rate for the 2-week trial period. To learn more about how to determine your salary rate and REP distribution, see the Worker Compensation section, below.

### During the Trial Period

The worker should check-in with her squad and / or onboarding guide every couple of days. Other DXdao contributors will also give feedback on completed work during this time.

### At the End of the Trial Period

The worker will meet with her squad guide to discuss her trial period review. This is an opportunity to determine progress and appropriate work fit. If the worker is able to complete her described scope of work, perfect. Keep doing what you’re doing. We welcome your further contributions to DXdao.

However, if the worker is not able to complete her described scope of work, the worker will be compensated for the work she has completed in good faith during the 2-week trial period. The community will notify the worker that she is no longer a worker for DXdao and will not be compensated for future work.

Work completed in good faith is determined by the squad leader, all relevant workers that have personal knowledge of what the worker did or did not complete, and any other relevant community members that have personal knowledge of the work completed by the worker during the trial period.

### Trial Period Checklist

-   Attend all squad calls, the community call + at least one (1) other regular DXdao call.
    
-   Check-in directly on Keybase with your squad guide directly at least once a week.
    
-   Complete assigned tasks in a timely manner.
    
-   At the conclusion of the first two weeks, meet with the onboarding guide for a trial period review.
    
-   Complete an updated scope-of-work proposal and submit to DAOtalk.org.
