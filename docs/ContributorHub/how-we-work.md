# How We Work

___

## Flat Hierarchy

DXdao governs itself based on consensus. There is no CEO. Decisions are made through a decentralized, democratic process.

Ideas are shared in a transparent manner on Keybase, Telegram, Discord, or a DXdao recorded meeting, and proposed more formally on DAOtalk.org. Through these channels, the DXdao community has the opportunity to refine and question these proposals in order to come to consensus on the direction of DXdao.

DXdaoâ€™s flat hierarchical structure also encourages workers to work effectively with a high degree of autonomy. If you see a problem, fix it. If you have an idea, share it on DAOtalk.org or any other community medium to get the ball rolling on how to implement it.

## Squads

DXdao functions in teams of workers that are referred to as squads. Workers within each squad coordinate responsibilities amongst themselves to further the interests of the DXdao community and its products. Each squad focuses on a specific product and / or area of business.

**DXdao Squads**:

-   Business Development
    
-   Ecosystem and Product Development
    
-   Governance
    
-   Marketing / Communications
    
-   Mesa
    
-   Omen
    
-   Swapr
    
## Squad Leaders

Each squad has a squad leader that is the point of contact for inter-squad coordination and new workers. The squad leader takes on an organizational role in roadmapping strategy and tracking the progress of workers within the squad. This is a relatively new position that has been recently created in DXdao. The intention is to have rotating squad leaders

## Business Hours

As a jurisdictionless organization that exists on the Ethereum blockchain, DXdao does not have set business hours. Workers are expected to be available during the week and may participate in weekend meetings, when necessary.

Each worker should communicate the timezone and hours in which she is available to the people in her squad(s) and to <a href="https://daotalk.org/u/keenanl/summary" target="_blank">Keenan</a>. Your hours will be placed on a DXdao airtable for others to access.

## Holidays

DXdao contributors are welcome to take their respective national, cultural, and / or religious holidays. It is recommended that DXdao workers take off twelve (12) days per year that are considered paid national holidays. This is, however, flexible. It is important to communicate that you are not available for a holiday to other workers before the day in question.  

**DXdao Holidays**: 
- New Years Day (Jan. 1)
    
## Vacation

Workers are encouraged to take vacation when needed. This time should be communicated to the community and be reduced from your worker compensation based on the number of days you intend to take off.
