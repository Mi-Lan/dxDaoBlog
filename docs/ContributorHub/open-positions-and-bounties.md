## Open Positions

DXdao is a decentralized collective that builds and governs DeFi protocols. It was spawned in the spring of 2019; over 450 addresses have Reputation (REP), which is non-transferrable and governs DXdao. In May of 2020, DXdao launched a bonding curve fundraiser and issued the DXD token, which has a claim on profits from DXdao’s products. DXdao’s product suite includes Omen, a leading prediction markets platform, Swapr, a governance-enabled and multi-chain AMM with adjustable fees, and Mesa, a decentralized IDO platform.

DXdao is entirely on-chain. Everything from hiring decisions to product updates happen through its governance system, based on holographic consensus.

## HR/People Mover

DXdao is a decentralized collective, native to the internet, but it still needs processes and norms on how we work (well) together. This role will need to think about the traditional things that HR focuses on, hiring/retaining top talent + creating a fair and fun work environment, but will need to build new frameworks and standards for a new type of organization.

**An HR/People Mover will**:

-   Own the worker onboarding process and help workers navigate on-chain proposals
    
-   Build tools and processes to allow for cross-collaboration and management without a bureaucratic hierarchy

## Marketing/Narrative Builder

DXdao’s on-chain governance and transparent product management engage a small community of enthusiasts, but it needs a strategic mind to craft this into a cohesive narrative for the rest of the industry. Moreover, the three primary products (Omen, Swapr and Mesa) come with their own brand story. This role will need to develop an overarching narrative for DXdao and its products and execute on a content strategy to tell this story to the broader cryptocurrency space. This is a great opportunity to tell a story about a unique and storied project on Ethereum.

**A Marketing/Narrative builder will**:

-   Work with the community and product teams to construct a narrative for DXdao and its products
    
-   Execute end-to-end marketing campaigns, coordinating content creation and brand continuity
    
-   Build and maintain relationships in the DAO/DeFi ecosystem to ensure brand-quality and penetration
    
-   Be an advocate for DXdao, its products and the community
    
**DXdao is looking for**:

-   An independent, forward thinking person that can work across time zones and cultures

## Treasury manager/accounting

The community has begun diversifying the treasury into stablecoins and making plans to seed liquidity into DXdao products and other investments. This role will help the community make portfolio allocation decisions by working with product teams and understanding DXdao’s future costs. This role will serve as a hub of information and support for the community-led investment decisions.

**A portfolio/treasury manager will**:

-   Research portfolio allocation decisions into DXdao products, assets or other on-chain opportunities
    
-   Prepare proposals to be submitted to DXdao governance for treasury movements
    
-   Compose quarterly updates on the state of the DXdao’s treasury
    
-   Develop forward-looking projections for DXdao products and treasury

-   A DAO/DeFi enthusiast who believes in the power of decentralization
    
-   Intimate knowledge of existing DeFi protocols and investing on-chain
    
-   Previous experience in data analysis, writing investment reports or visualizing financial data (accounting experience also a plus)
