# Open Positions

___

DXdao is a decentralized collective that builds and governs DeFi protocols. It was spawned in the spring of 2019; over 450 addresses have Reputation (REP), which is non-transferrable and governs DXdao. In May of 2020, DXdao launched a bonding curve fundraiser and issued the DXD token, which has a claim on profits from DXdao’s products. DXdao’s product suite includes Omen, a leading prediction markets platform, Swapr, a governance-enabled and multi-chain AMM with adjustable fees, and Mesa, a decentralized IDO platform.

DXdao is entirely on-chain. Everything from hiring decisions to product updates happen through its governance system, based on holographic consensus.
