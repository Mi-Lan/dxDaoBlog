## STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

### Conflicts of Interest

Workers have an obligation to the DXdao community to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. DXdao’s conflict of interest policy establishes only the framework within which DXdao chooses to conduct business. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide workers with general information so that you can get further direction from other community members when you need guidance on issues related to a possible conflict of interest.

Workers may not engage in outside activities that conflict with, or could be perceived as conflicting with, the interests of DXdao, including but not limited to:  

-   Using your position to influence a decision that may result in personal gain for you, a relative, or a friend as a result of DXdao’s business dealings.

-   Having a financial relationship or financial interest with a supplier, vendor, or competing entity, employee, or other entity having business dealings with DXdao that may negatively impact DXdao.
    
-   Using DXdao’s name as a part of any outside promotional campaign or other business endeavor.
    
### Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing

Workers have an obligation to act in good faith and to deal fairly with other DXdao workers and contributors. Examples of not acting in good faith are the following:

-   Pretending to be someone else for the purpose of obtaining a position with DXdao.  

-   Falsely claiming to have completed work that was in fact never completed or completed in a substandard manner for the purpose of receiving compensation.
