## WORKER PROPOSALS

### When to Submit a Worker Proposal.

Once a worker proposal has been boosted, the proposal takes approximately 7 days to pass. With this time-frame in mind, a worker should submit their proposal on Alchemy one week before she intends to be compensated for her work. It is the workerâ€™s responsibility to submit her worker proposals in a timely manner. And keep track of what she has been paid.

### Worker Proposal Format -- What to Include

-   **Title:** [NAME] Worker Proposal [DATE - DATE]

-   **Background**:

	-   If this is your first worker proposal, state any context for making the proposal, including:
    

		-   What position you will be filling -- i.e. developer, marketing, governance, etc.
    
		-   Who you have been in contact with regarding the position (add their DAOtalk usernames)
    

	-   If you are a continuing worker, state which products and areas you are working on / any other relevant background information
    
-   **Timeframe**: state the date range, typically 2 months (2.5 months for first-time workers)
    

-   **Goals**: State the products and / or strategy areas you will be working under. E.g. Omen and governance. Include both short-term goals that you seek to accomplish during the working period and long-term goals.
    

-   **Responsibilities**: List the specific deliverables you will be either completing and / or working on during the working period. Try to state which deliverables you intend to complete within the period and which are long-term or ongoing projects.
    

-   **If You Are A Returning Worker, Write a Self-Reflection**:
    
	-   state what you did well, what you did okay, and what you need to improve on

-   **Compensation**:
    
	-   Experience Level: 1-5
    
	-   Time commitment: Full-time, Part-time, Percent (%) time
    
	-   [ETH AMT] for 2 months of work at level 4, to be sent half on the first payment proposal and half on the second payment
    
	-   [DXD AMT] vested for 2 years with a 1 year cliff starting the [DATE WORK PERIOD STARTS]
    
	-   [% AMT REP] = to be sent in the second payment proposal
    
-   **Work Experience**:
    
	-   Prior DXdao work proposals (if applicable)
    
	-   Past Work for DXdao

		-   If a developer, Github links
