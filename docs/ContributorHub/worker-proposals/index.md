# Worker Proposals

___

## When to Submit a Worker Proposal

Once a worker proposal has been boosted, the proposal takes approximately 7 days to pass. With this time-frame in mind, a worker should submit their proposal on Alchemy one week before she intends to be compensated for her work. It is the workerâ€™s responsibility to submit her worker proposals in a timely manner, and keep track of what she has been paid.

## Worker Proposal Format -- What to Include

### **Title**:

[NAME] Worker Proposal [DATE - DATE]

### **Background**:

If this is your first worker proposal, state any context for making the proposal, including:
    

-   What position you will be filling -- i.e. developer, marketing, governance, etc.
    
-   Who you have been in contact with regarding the position (add their DAOtalk usernames)
    
If you are a continuing worker, state which products and areas you are working on / any other relevant background information
    
### **Timeframe**: 

State the date range, typically 2 months (2.5 months for first-time workers).

Include both short-term goals that you seek to accomplish during the working period and long-term goals.

List the specific deliverables you will be either completing and / or working on during the working period. Try to state which deliverables you intend to complete within the period and which are long-term or ongoing projects.
