#  xDai Worker Proposal Guide

___


## Intro:

-   Congratulations on getting the signal to submit a worker proposal to DXdao!
    
-   At this point, you’ve started the onboarding process, posted a draft of your worker proposal on <a href="https://daotalk.org" target="_blank">Daotalk</a>, and the proposal was signalled for an on-chain DXdao vote.
    
-   For details on what should be in the worker proposal, visit the [Worker Compensation]({% link docs/ContributorHub/worker-proposals/index.md %}) section.
    
-   After the <a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a/proposal/0x2a4f24200eb1ef626e9aea29bad2494689f979c00c6fff17b5b0cd38712be426" target="_blank">xDai authorization proposal</a> , workers can now submit proposals on xDXdao base on xDai and save gas.
    
## When to Submit Your Worker Proposal:

-   How long a boosted worker proposal would take depends on funding and voting power scheme. For mainnet DXdao that’s 7 days to pass after boosting, and for xDXdao on xDai that’s 4 days. Boosted proposals can pass with a relative majority.
    
-   If a proposal is not boosted, the voting period will last 21 days. Unboosted proposals must pass with an absolute majority.
    
-   A proposal is generally eligible to be boosted 1 day after it’s been posted on Alchemy. Boosting a proposal is a ‘bet’ that the proposal will pass. Boosters receive a reward if the proposal passes and lose their stake if the proposal fails.  You can boost your own worker proposal once it is eligible to be boosted, request to be boosted from a member of the Contributor Experience squad or any DXdao community member. 
    
-   **The Point**:  *If you intend to receive payment for your work with DXdao by a certain date, you must submit your Alchemy worker proposal at least 1 week in advance and request to have it boosted the next day, in order for the voting period to shrink to 1 week.*
    
-   An explanation of Daostack’s holographic consensus from its architect can be found <a href="https://daostack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002000537-Genesis-Protocol-v0-2-Parameters-Explained" target="_blank">here</a>.
    

  

## What You’ll Need:

1. An ERC-20 token wallet where you will receive your payment once a proposal passes.
2. A small amount of xDai (less than $0.25 USD), in order to submit the proposal. Feel free to reach out to someone on the Contributor Experience squad or any DXdao contributor to send you a small amount of xDai to complete your transaction.
3. If you want to boost your own proposal, get some GEN, the Daostack token. This is not necessary, but DXdao contributors can boost proposals by staking GEN to speed up the execution process. 
4. A wallet address where you’ll receive your REP: non-transferable voting rights used for voting on proposals. This can be the same as your payment address, but as REP cannot be transferred, pick an address that you will always have access to.
    
**Recommended**: Use a <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">Metamask</a> wallet that has the same address on xDai and Ethereum. <a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052711572-How-to-connect-to-the-xDai-network" target="_blank">Here</a> you’ll find guidance on how to add xDai to your wallet’s network list.
    

  

**Step 1**: Go to <a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f" target="_blank">Alchemy, DXdao’s voting interface</a>, and click ‘<a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/schemes" target="_blank">Plugins</a>’. Now is the best time to connect your wallet and switch to **xDai network**.

**Step 2**: Click the ‘<a href="https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xe716ec63c5673b3a4732d22909b38d779fa47c3f/scheme/0xd42eee8731e00be92c283377f38126269a004f3c12da32e9a87d72f197b0540c" target="_blank">Funding and Voting Power</a>’ scheme.

**Step 3**: Calculate your REP allocation

- First, determine if you are a full-time or part-time worker.
	- Full-time workers: may claim 0.1667% REP  for each month they work for DXdao. 
	- Part-time workers: may claim 0.08335% REP per month.   
	- Other compensation proposals (bounties, limited contractors, etc.): 	To determine how much REP to request, ask community members and state the amount in your daotalk.org worker proposal post. The amount will be somewhere between 0.1% to 0.1667% REP. 
	- Please use the Worker Compensation Calculator to assist with determining your REP allocation.

-   Use <a href="" target="_blank">this calculator</a> to calculate. Fill in the Blue squares with your information.
    
-   Calculate the amount of ETH/Dai for your worker proposal payment using your determined monthly compensation level. See the DXdao [Compensation Table]({% link docs/ContributorHub/worker-compensation.md %}). Find the ETH price if you are requesting WETH.
    
-   For DXD, find the monthly amount on Contributor Guidelines, and then divide that number by the all-time price of DXD on Coingecko (currently $523). This must be vested. While we build a vesting contract system, please record the # of DXD for your worker proposal in the proposal text
    
-   For REP, each worker is due 0.1667% of mainnet REP each month. As the total amount of REP changes, the amount of REP to each worker is noted at the beginning of each month on the xDai Authorization forum thread. Use this number for your REP award on xDai (prorated if part-time) and also note the main net REP award amount in the proposal text.
    
-   xDai proposals cannot reward mainnet REP - awards will be batched and sent to multiple addresses once a quarter. You can ask for your monthly contributor REP award in xDai REP. This will allow you to vote on proposals on xDai. .
    

  

**Step 4**: Click on the ‘+ New Proposal’ button in the top right corner and connect your wallet.

**Note**: Submitting a proposal will require gas, but don’t worry! DXdao refunds 75% of gas costs. <a href="https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-governance-refunds-round-2/2361" target="_blank">Find more information here</a>.

  

### Recommended step:  
  
To make your proposal verifiable and secure, it is ideal to add your Keybase Cryptographic Signature into your proposal.

To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Go to Keybase (on desktop or mobile)
    
2.  Go to “Crypto” in navigation
    
3.  Click “Sign”
    
4.  Type any message into the input field
    
5.  Copy the Signed Message to your Clipboard
    
6.  Paste the entire Signed Message into your Proposal
    
Anyone using Keybase will be able to “Verify” what the Signed Message is and that it is from your Keybase handle.
