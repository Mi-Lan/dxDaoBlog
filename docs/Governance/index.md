# DXdao Governance

___ 

## Our Philosophy  
  
Decentralization is at the heart of DXdaoâ€™s operations and developments. We make decisions as a collective without a central authority. In order to further this goal, we put all strategy and budget decisions to an on-chain vote.

As an evolving and amorphous collective, we are discovering what it means to self-govern, improve our workflow, and profitably scale. In conducting this experiment, we update our governance structures to respond to the needs of the DXdao community and product ecosystem to serve its users trustlessly.
