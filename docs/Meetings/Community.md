## SNAPSHOT  

DXD holders use Snapshot to create polls for a variety of governance-related topics of DXdao. If you are a DXD holder and would like to create a proposal regarding a particular topic for DXD holders to vote on, go to [https://snapshot.page/#/dxd.eth/](https://snapshot.page/#/dxd.eth/).

REP holders are committed to respecting the majority wishes of DXD holders, and strongly take into consideration any signal given from a DXD holder Snapshot poll.
