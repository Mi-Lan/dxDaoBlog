## HOW TO GAIN REP

Any community member that contributes to DXdao, either by participating in community discussions, making posts on DAOtalk.org, or contributing in any meaningful way may also receive REP. DXdao currently operates a [REP Boost Program](https://daotalk.org/t/community-rep-boosts-jan-2021/2562) where community members that make a contribution to DXdao during a given month are nominated for a 0.1% REP boost.

Community members that receive a REP boost need to submit a REP boost proposal on [Alchemy](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x519b70055af55a007110b4ff99b0ea33071c720a). Here is a link for [How-to Submit a REP Boost Proposal on Alchemy.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKD2IZV4ffnUx3csccaRpWEvPsOvcbmg8Ffd0l5HpEE/edit)

If you believe that you should receive REP for a DXdao contribution, contact [Chris](https://daotalk.org/u/powers/summary) on DAOtalk.org to be nominated. DXdao welcomes nominating new community members for REP, and we are looking for new effective ways to allocate REP, while still honoring DXdao’s merit-based governance system. If you have a suggestion on how to allocate REP, please state it in the #governance channel on the [dx_dao](https://keybase.io/team/dx_dao) Keybase or [DAOtalk.org](https://daotalk.org/c/dx-dao/15).

Full-time workers may earn up to 4% REP for paid contributions to DXdao. A worker may request 0.1667% of REP for each month she has worked.

## DAOTALK

[DAOtalk.org](https://daotalk.org/c/dx-dao/15) is DXdao’s forum of choice for presenting formal proposals to the DXdao community. This is the place to present and receive feedback for an on-chain vote regarding DXdao strategy, a worker proposal, or other initiative. Proposals at this stage are often modified to reflect the signal received from the DXdao community in the comments section and polls.
