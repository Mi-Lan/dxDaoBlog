## GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY  
  
Decentralization is the heart of DXdaoâ€™s operations and developments. We aim to incorporate all actions, procedures, product development, and community involvement under the notion that we are a collective that makes decisions without a central authority. In order to further this goal, we put all strategy and budget decisions to an on-chain vote.

We build products that are intended to serve its users trustlessly. We consciously implement preventative measures for governance exploits that may offset the balance of voting power among us. As an evolving and amorphous collective, we are discovering what it means to self-govern, improve our workflow, and profitably scale without a centralized authority. In conducting this experiment, we are constantly seeking to update our governance structures to respond to the needs of our community and product ecosystem.
