# Welcome to Mesa! 

___

[**Mesa**](https://mesa.eth.link/) is an Open Source interface for [Gnosis Protocol](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol/) maintained, owned, and hosted by [DXdao](https://dxdao.eth.link/#/). Experience a fully permissionless DEX that enables ring trades to maximize liquidity. Ring trades are order settlements which share liquidity across all orders, rather than a single token pair, and uniquely suited for trading prediction market tokens and the long tail of all tokenized assets.

Mesa is currently undergoing a transition process to focus on [initial DEX offerings, or IDOâ€™s](https://youtu.be/VzdgNeN73Zk?t=996).
