## Welcome to Omen!

[Omen](https://omen.eth.link/) is a fully decentralized prediction market platform built on the [Gnosis conditional token framework](https://docs.gnosis.io/conditionaltokens/). Users can create and/or participate in information markets on various topics (crypto, politics, sports, etc.) and stake their crypto on possible outcomes. Once an Omen market has reached the closing date, anyone can start the process of crowdsourcing the search for the correct answer. This is powered by [reality.eth.link](https://reality.eth.link/). In the case of a dispute, an arbitrator can be called to make a judgment.
